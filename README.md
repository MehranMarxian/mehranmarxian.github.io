 MEHRAN-AHMADI PERSONAL WEBSITE
This is my personal website, and my first attempt to make a website using code

v.0125:

Website Setup: working with GitHub Pages and previously imported an old Adobe Muse HTML project. 

I've also been experimenting with Adobe Dreamweaver and learning coding in this context.

Font and Style: successfully implemented the PT Sane font for the site, working on replacing the default web fonts.

Responsive Design: working on making the site responsive with media queries, especially focusing on mobile devices.

Form PHP Issue: addressing an issue where your submission form indicates that the PHP script is missing or not configured properly on your web server.

Slideshow and Visuals: been working on customizing the home slideshow images and fixing other visual elements.
